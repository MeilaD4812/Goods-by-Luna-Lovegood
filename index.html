        <p>The Lovegoods are a very "interesting" (by "interesting" I mean kind of strange) wizrading family in the Harry Potter series. Luna Lovegood (sometimes called Loony because people think she is weird) is one year younger than Harry and is also a student at Hogwarts during the series. Harry meets Luna in the Order of the Phoenix, the fifth book. Luna's Dad, Xenophilius Lovegood, is the editor of the Quibbler magazine and is just as interesting as her. In fact, he is probably where she got her interesting from. Luna's Mom is Pandora Lovegood, and she died when Luna was nine years old. Pandora liked to experiment with spells and died when one backfired. She is probably where Luna got her bravery from. Here are some descriptions of the items that Luna, and her father, had or liked during the series.</p>
